To start the app, simply run the following command from the project's directory in your terminal:

### `docker-compose up`

Yes, it's that easy!

Don't believe me?

Open up your browser and type "localhost"; hit enter and you should see your app running. 
You also get hot reloading for both the app and the test suites :)

### PS: Must have docker and docker-compose installed on your machine
